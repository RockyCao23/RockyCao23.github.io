      Art Metal

    <h4>
      Metalwork Project | Dec 2018
    </h4>
    <p>
      Created in my metalwork class, this is a balancing desk toy and a piece of art. The initial design brief was to create a balancing toy but with cylindrical weights on both ends, and a sheetmetal cutout as the balancing center piece. However, I took the extra step to replace one of the weights with a 3D person snowboarding instead.

      Created in my Drafting and Design class, the left-most image drawing displays a 900 sq.ft condo I designed and drew on AutoCAD. The condo consists of two bedrooms, two bath, and an office. The center image is a combination of four identical condos to make up an apartment floor. The right-most image is one of many orthographic drawings I have made.

    <p>

      Created as a bonus assignment, I attempted to use natural oscillations to create art. Inspired by the harmonograph in Science World Vancouver, I decided to build my own harmonograph which consisted of using common household items and my bunk bed.
